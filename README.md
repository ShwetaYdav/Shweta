# Shweta
Hey there everyone! Shweta this side.
Goa to Mumbai is just not a movie for me.
I am a software engineer by profession.
I have a knack for overthinking and procrastination.
I can paint, sing and write ( and for all the times i am doing nothing , I overthink! Cause NOT Overthinking is so mainstream yeah :D )
